This repo contains the [Vagrant][] configuration and [Chef][] recipes for
spinning up an [Ubuntu][] Oneiric Ocelot (11.10) Server development box, under
a Vagrant-managed virtual machine.

The Vagrantfile uses [Chef][] recipes from this repository and from my
[common Chef repository][].

Props to [Toby DiPasquale](https://github.com/codeslinger) for providing
both an Oneiric box file and a similar repo with juicy bits ripe for the
cribbing.
